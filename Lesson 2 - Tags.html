     <p> Seven billion people are on this Earth, and everybody is different from the rest of others. There is nothing without purpose in this world. Everything has some purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each person is exclusive. Though, it is quite hard to write about yourself yet I have tried myself best to express all about myself in this website.</p>
     
    <p align=”justify”> My name is Samyuktha and I hail from Chennai. I come from a Hindu family and I am a student of eighth grade. I study at KC High and I am the apple of the eye for my parents. 
        My father has his own construction company firm and my mother is a housewife.
        I have a passion for Yoga. A lot of honours and awards have been bagged by me in yoga competitions. Also, I have a passion for digital art and love to play with colours using my imagination.</p>
    <p>While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers, I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur. I don't remember when I fell in love with it, but my passion for it has increased over the years. Over the past few months, I have started living this dream by researching and learning it through my new school. My parents have always supported my dreams and aspirations. According to them, the only way to achieve all your goals is to work hard and never give up on them. They have never imposed themselves and demanded that I can become what I want. Instead, they wanted me to choose a career and a life that would give us joy and stability.
        Successes and failures are closely associated with one's achievements and losses. One who achieves anything today has lost a thing yesterday. There is no completely successful man without the mixture of both failures and successes. That is to say, I failed a dozen of times. But, every failure made me stronger ever.
        What I myself regard life is a total pot of opportunities. One has to harness one's skills and abilities to the maximum of one's capacity. For every problem there is a solution. I regard the life as a blessing gift to humanity. One should strive hard to improve not only his lot but for his fellow beings.</p> 
    <p>Therefore, in writing about myself, I have expressed to myself that what I have seen, what I have experienced and what I plan for my life is the total manifestation of what I do today. I have learnt the real meaning and worth of life from my parents. I am with a happy, focused and hardworking family. That is definitely the greatest blessing of God for me. </p>
